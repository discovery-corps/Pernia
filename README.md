# Pernia - the React frontend for Discovery Corps

## Development

The application requires two files - vendor.js and app.js.  Both will be built by any of the compile scripts.

1. `npm run watch` - run the hot reloading dev server; content will be at https://localhost:8080.

2. `npm run build-js-dev` - build a development copy of the application at `public/`.

3. `npm run build-js-prd` - build the production bundle at `public/`.
